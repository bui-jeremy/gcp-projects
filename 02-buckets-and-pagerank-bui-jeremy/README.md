# Assignment 2: Buckets and PageRank

## Directions

Use the Python client that was give to you to generate a directory of 10K files with a
max link count of 250. Copy the created files into a directory under a storage bucket on
cloud google storage. Write a program in Python that opens the bucket, reads the list of
files, reads each file and computes the following properties:

- Average, Median, Max, Min and Quintiles of incoming and outgoing links across
all the files.
- Construct a graph of the pages, and compute their pagerank (PR) and output the
top 5 pages by their pagerank score.
- Code the original iterative pagerank algorithm where `PR(A) = 0.15 + 0.85
(PR(T1)/C(T1) + â€¦ +PR(Tn)/C(Tn))` where `PR(X)` is the pagerank of a page `X`,
`T1..Tn` are all the pages pointing to page `X`, and `C(X)` is the number of outgoing
links that page `X` has. Iterate until the sum of pageranks across all pages does
not change by more than .5% across iterations.

Make sure your storage bucket is in a datacenter close to you and you can run your
program either on your laptop directly or on your google cloud shell instance. Make
sure your bucket is world readable (give the right ACL permissions) so your program
can be tested against your bucket by the TFs. In your report include your total spend on
cloud resources for the development and execution of this program.

## Submission

What to include in this repo: 
- A PDF or markdown file describing what you did including all relevant instructions on
how to run and verify your code (i.e. your project name, your bucket name, the way to
run your program, the meaning of any parameters it accepts etc).
- The program itself
