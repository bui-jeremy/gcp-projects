# Assignment 7: Apache Beam and Dataflow

## Directions

*In this homework we will build on top of the work from Homework 2*
1. Use Apache Beam and Cloud Data Flow to do some data processing on the files in
your cloud bucket. In particular you should find and print out the top 5 files with
the most incoming links, and top 5 files with the most outgoing links (hint: the
second should be much easier)
2. Run your code both on your local laptop and on the cloud dataflow engine and
report on the respective runtimes.

## Submission

What to include in this repo: 
- The python code for your app
- A PDF or markdown file describing all the necessary steps to configure and run your app, the
output of your code, and an explanation of what your code does.
